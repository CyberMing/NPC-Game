# NPCgame Privacy Notice
 

AA Zoo School is an augmented reality (AR) viewer customized from Mozilla open source project WebXR Viewer that lets you run AR experiences on the web.  When you use the app, Mozilla collect certain information so that they can improve the WebXR project. 

The developer of AA Zoo School does not collect user data, but does receive App Analytics reports provided by Apple based on user data to improve the app. Please read [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/) about this. 

- *Information Mozilla Collect Automatically When You Use*: The App starts sending Mozilla data once you install the application and start using it on your device. This includes:
   - _Interaction data_: The App sends data to Mozilla about your interactions with the application. This includes information such as when you launch the app, when you background or foreground the Viewer, and when you load a webpage that activates the AR capabilities of the Viewer. Mozilla don’t track any of the webpages you access through the Viewer.
   - _Technical data_: The app sends data to Mozilla about your app version, device operating system, and basic information about crashes and errors. When the app sends data to Mozilla, your IP address is temporarily collected as part of our server logs.

Read the Mozilla's telemetry documentation for [iOS](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/webxr-ios/blob/master/Telemetry.md).

- *Turning-off Data Collection*: Data collection can be disabled by you at anytime, which will stop corresponding data collection by the app. This can be done by going to the Settings page in the app application, which directs you to the iOS Settings panel.  

- *Non-Mozilla Services*: We use Apple ARKit which integrates the iOS device camera and motion features to produce augmented reality experiences in the app. Apple may collect information about your location as part of its ARKit functionality. To learn more about Apple’s data collection practices related to this integration, we encourage you to review their [Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/). 

- *AR Data Provided to Web Pages*: When web pages use AR, they receive information from ARKit via the WebXR API. You can learn more about ARKit on [Apple's ARKit Web Page](https://developer.apple.com/arkit/).  All web pages will know the position and motion of the phone in the room around you (but not your real-world location), as well as any vertical or horizontal planes that ARKit detects (such as walls, floors and tables). Mozilla does not receive this information.

- *Advanced AR Features the require additional Permission*: ARKit can recognize images provided by a web page (such as a movie poster or picture in a magazine). The app will ask for your permission (for "*Access to World Sensing*") before letting web pages use these features. If you approve, the page will receive the position of the image in the world when it is recognized.  ARKit and the app does not ever provide the raw data from the TrueDepth camera to web pages. We do not receive this information.

- *Direct Camera Access*:  If a web page wants to access the video images from the camera, the app will ask for your permission before providing video images to the web page. We do not receive this information.
